Today I bought Minecraft for Windows 10 from the Windows Store. However, after launching the game, it immediately crashed. I made sure all my drivers were updated, but the game still crashed.

I found a page mentioning Windows Media Pack. I tried installing it, and that solved my issue.

1. Open "Apps & features"
1. Click "Optional features"
1. Click "Add a feature"
1. Find "Windows Media Pack"
1. Install it
