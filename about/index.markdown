## Career

I graduated from the [University of Florida](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2003 and a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering in 2005.

My first job out of college was a remote PHP web developer position with [Clayton Kendall](https://www.claytonkendall.com/) where I maintained their e-commerce website, developed a framework for brand customization, and integrated the application with third party accouting software.

In 2007, I joined [SuperStock](https://www.superstock.com/), a stock photography agency, as a software engineer.  I helped update the web application from classic ASP to ASP.NET.

In 2008, I participated in [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/)'s Summer '08 batch along with Joel Hoard and Luke Bearden.  Even though our ideas did not pan out, the experience was memorable.  I learned a lot about start ups, and met many interesting people.

After Y Combinator, I started working at [AutoLoop](https://www.autoloop.com/).  (They have since merged with Affinitiv.)  I was hired specifically to work on their partner company's new project [ASR Pro](https://www.asrpro.com).  ASR Pro was one of the first fully electronic vehicle multi-point inspection software available at the time.  Even though the software has changed name through multiple acquisitions, it remains one of the best in its class.

In 2012, I transitioned over as [ASR Pro](https://www.asrpro.com)'s CTO.  I helped put together a fully distributed engineering team.  We designed and built APIs, improved the system scalability and reliability, and expanded our third party integration.  I also had the opportunity to mentor team members and provide leadership and an environment where they can excel.

In 2014, ASR Pro was acquired by [Dealertrack](https://us.dealertrack.com/).  I switched role to software engineering manager and helped my team through the transition.  ASR Pro was rebranded as Service Pro.

In 2016, Dealertrack was acquired by [Cox Automotive](https://www.coxautoinc.com/).  Service Pro was moved under a subsidiary Xtime and rebranded again as [Xtime Inspect](https://xtime.com/xtime-spectrum/inspect/).  In 2018, I transitioned to software architect and shifted my focus back the technical side where I currently am today.
